#portfolio
My personal portfolio. Features a JavaScript client and CMS which consumes a Node.JS RESTful API backend. Also includes a GruntJS based approach for automated building, testing and deployment.

I've added the code to GitHub, sans sensitive configuration files, so that prospective employers, clients and colleagues can have a snoop around my code
i know this is the worst readme file but this is just a begineer level readme so dont expect aggressive UI's.
